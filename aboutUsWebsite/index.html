            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are Tech Quest, a team of five passionate Computer Science students from the University of Wollongong in
                Dubai. Our journey began with a shared vision: to leverage technology to create meaningful, engaging, and
                impactful educational experiences. As part of our final-year project, we developed an AI-powered interactive
                storytelling and learning platform designed to revolutionize digital education for young learners.</p>
            <p>With backgrounds in system architecture, AI integration, software development, and user experience, we
                combined our expertise to craft a seamless learning environment that adapts to each user's needs. Our
                application fosters personalized learning by integrating artificial intelligence, natural language
                processing, and dynamic difficulty adjustment to create immersive and adaptive educational
                experiences.</p>
