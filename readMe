YourStory App

Overview
YourStory is an interactive storytelling app designed for kids. It provides engaging, AI-generated stories tailored to a child’s preferences and reading level.
The app tracks a child's reading progress and performance over the past seven days, including the number of stories completed and total time spent reading. 
Parents can monitor their child's engagement and growth through an intuitive dashboard. The app integrates Firebase for data storage and management.

The app also generates quiz questions based on the story content to assess comprehension. 
Using an AI model trained with GPT-2, it formulates questions, provides answer options, and highlights the correct answer. 
The dataset consists of long sentences, with additional columns for questions, correct answers, and four answer options. 

Features
AI-Powered Story Generation
- Utilizes trained GPT-2 models to generate rich, interactive stories.
- Fetches themes from Firebase to align stories with children's interests.
- Ensures coherence and logical progression in narratives.

Question & Quiz Generation
- The AI model generates quizzes based on the story's content.
- Ensures each question has exactly four answer options.
- Helps assess reading comprehension and engagement.

User Accounts & Authentication
- Secure authentication using Firebase Authentication.
- Parents can create accounts and manage multiple child profiles.
- Children access stories via their respective profiles.

Reading Progress Tracking
- Tracks the number of stories completed by each child in the past 7 days.
- Logs total time spent reading.
- Provides insights for parents to understand reading habits.
- Displays student performance data based on past engagement.

Story Storage & Retrieval
- Uses Firestore Database to store and retrieve stories.
- Stories are saved under each child’s unique identifier (e.g., `child_1`, `child_2`).
- Parents can review previously read stories.

Performance Analytics
- Encourages consistent reading habits through progress tracking.
- Uses Firebase to fetch and analyze student performance based on the last 7 days.

Hugging Face Model Setup (IMPORTANT)
To generate AI-powered stories, you need to start the Hugging Face model manually:
1. Open the following link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/abdalraheemdmd/story-image-api/tree/main
2. Log in to Hugging Face with your credentials.

HuggingFace Credentials:
email: abdalraheemdmd@gmail.com
password: Saba@5858 ('S' is capital)

3. Go to Settings and select "Nvidia T4 medium" under the hardware section.
4. Wait a few minutes for the model to load.
5. Once the model is running, you can generate stories within the app.

Firebase Structure
The app leverages Firestore to organize data efficiently. Below is an overview of the database structure:

`parents` Collection
Each parent document is identified by a unique user ID (UID).

Parent Document Fields:
```json
{
  "name": "Parent Name",
  "email": "parent@example.com",
  "children": {
    "child_1": { "name": "Alice", "age": 6 },
    "child_2": { "name": "Bob", "age": 8 }
  }
}
```

`children` Collection (Nested under `parents`)
Each child has a document containing their reading history and quiz performance.
